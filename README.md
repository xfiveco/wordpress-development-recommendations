## Social Media Buttons
Social media buttons are blamed for their poor performance and privacy offending nature. Based on our [test of 10 popular social media buttons solutions](https://xhtmlized.com/blog/social-media-buttons-test-performance-privacy-features/) the following are recommendations what to use and what not to use in WordPress projects.

### Recommended solutions

#### 1) Custom buttons
- Excellent performance (9/10), flexibility, no privacy concerns
- Custom design can match overall UX/UI
- Create buttons, icons or links using [Social Share URLs](https://github.com/bradvin/social-share-urls)
- Query [SharedCount](http://www.sharedcount.com/) API for [number of shares](https://docs.sharedcount.com/)
- Alternatively, implement counters with [Barebones Share Buttons](https://github.com/finderau/share-buttons) or a similar library

#### 2) [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/)
- Good performance (6.2/10), no cookies set
- Brings functionality of Wordpress.com to self-hosted websites
- The share functionality is one of [35 different features](http://jetpack.me/)
- Neccessary to connect website to wordpress.com
- 2 button styles, hidden zeroes
- Counts shares correctly
- Easy to use WP admin

#### 3) [Share by Sumome](https://sumome.com/app/share)
- Fair performance (5.9/10), 1 cookie set
- Needs sign up
- A collection of tools for growing website traffic (List Builder, Heat Maps, etc.)
- Allows separate Facebook Share and Like buttons in one set
- Optimized for mobile, hides zeroes
- Easy to use admin interface

#### 4) [Simple Share Buttons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-share-buttons-adder/)
- Good performance (6.8/10), no cookies set
- Longer time loading first byte due to how the plugin is coded (no JS asynchronous loading, buttons and counts are generated in WP)
- Easy to use WP admin interface
- [Additional features](https://simplesharebuttons.com/plus/features/) in the Plus version (10 USD per site) which hides zeroes and improves performance by caching share counts

#### 5) [Flare by Filament](http://filament.io/flare)
- Good performance (6.8/10), no cookies set
- Needs sign up
- WP plugin just redirects to Flare account
- Doesn’t display on mobile at all which makes it really usable only with [Pro version](http://filament.io/flare#comparison) ($89 / year)
- Slightly cumbersome setup
